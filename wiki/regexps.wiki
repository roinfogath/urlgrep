#summary Some interesting regular expressions you might want to check

=== The following expressions can be used to check for dangerous URL ===

  * `(\?|&).+=.+\..+`
   ** This can match URL or file inclusion
  * `\?.+=.+`
   ** URLs that accept get requests (maybe some SQL injections behind)
  * `(\?|&)file.+=.+`
   ** That may look like LFI vulnerability

Feel free to suggest some expressions in comments!
