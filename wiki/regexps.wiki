#summary Some interesting regular expressions you might want to check

=== The following expressions can be used to check for dangerous URL ===

  * `\?.+=.+\..+`
   ** This can be file inclusion
  * `\?.+=.+`
   ** URLs that accept get requests (may be some SQL injections behind)
  * `(\?|&)file.+=.+`
   ** That may look like LFI vulnerability

Feel free to suggest some expressions in comments!
